# Archive Notes

`docs/90_archive` stores historical materials that are not authoritative for current implementation.

## Folders
- `legacy_docs/`: old snapshots or superseded docs.
- `legacy_workspace/`: migrated legacy workspace materials (including old Obsidian structure).

## Policy
- Do not delete archive files unless explicitly approved.
- Do not reference archive docs as current baseline without verification.
- Prefer `docs/01_design/*_latest.md` for current implementation understanding.

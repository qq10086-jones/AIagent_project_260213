# Docs Index

This `docs` directory has been reorganized for maintainability.

## Structure
- `00_overview/`: reorganization notes and migration map
- `01_design/`: latest design documentation (authoritative)
- `02_patch/`: patch-focused documents and patch index
- `03_feature_development/`: feature progress indexes and reports
- `90_archive/`: historical/legacy docs and old workspace material

## Start Here
- System design: `docs/01_design/system/system_design_latest.md`
- Quant design (latest): `docs/01_design/quant/quant_design_latest.md`
- Learning design (latest): `docs/01_design/learning/learning_design_latest.md`
- Web-augmented chat design (latest): `docs/01_design/web/web_augmented_chat_design_latest.md`
- Task protocol: `docs/01_design/system/task_queue_protocol.md`

## Notes
- Multiple-version docs were consolidated into `*_latest.md` where applicable.
- Older versions were moved to `docs/90_archive`.
- Migration map: `docs/00_overview/docs_migration_map_20260301.md`.
- One high-noise legacy progress file (2026-02-24) was archived and replaced by a readable placeholder.

# Docs Reorg Log (2026-03-01)

## What Changed
- Reorganized docs by purpose: design, patch, feature progress, archive.
- Consolidated latest design docs into:
  - `system_design_latest.md`
  - `quant_design_latest.md`
  - `learning_design_latest.md`
  - `web_augmented_chat_design_latest.md`
- Moved old versions and Obsidian workspace docs to `90_archive`.

## Why
- Reduce duplication and ambiguity.
- Make current authoritative docs easy to locate.
- Preserve old references without polluting active docs.
